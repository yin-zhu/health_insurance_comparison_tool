# HealthInsuranceComparisonTool

This tool enables a user to choose from a list of health insurance plans the ones she likes.
Then based on her state, age, and smoker status calculates out of the plans she liked which one is the cheapest for her.
The core calculation looks up a hashtable @penalty_table and find the right penalty given her situation.
